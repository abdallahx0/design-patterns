# Design Patterns Practice Project

This project is designed to practice and understand different software design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design, categorized into three main groups:

1. **Behavioral Design Patterns**
2. **Creational Design Patterns**
3. **Structural Design Patterns**

Each folder in this project contains examples and implementations of design patterns belonging to one of these categories. Below is a brief description of each folder and its purpose.

---

## Folder Structure

### 1. `BehavioralDesignPatterns`
This folder contains patterns that focus on effective communication and interaction between objects. These patterns help define how objects should behave and interact with each other to achieve flexibility and reusable code.

#### Patterns included:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Each pattern demonstrates its use case with examples and is accompanied by explanations in its individual README.md file.

---

### 2. `CreationalDesignPatterns`
This folder includes patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms. These patterns aim to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation while ensuring flexibility and reusability.

#### Patterns included:
- Factory[Abstract and Factory Method]
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

Each pattern implementation focuses on how to create objects effectively while abstracting the instantiation process.

---

### 3. `StructuralDesignPatterns`
This folder contains patterns that deal with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns help ensure that the structures are flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain.

#### Patterns included:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

Each pattern explains how to assemble objects and classes to create larger, more efficient structures.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Navigate to the appropriate folder**: Each folder focuses on one category of design patterns. Choose the folder based on the type of problem you are trying to solve.
2. **Explore individual patterns**: Inside each folder, you’ll find subfolders or files for individual patterns. Each pattern includes:
   - Implementation code
   - A detailed README.md file explaining the pattern, its use case, and a code example.
3. **Run the examples**: Study and execute the provided examples to understand how each pattern works in practice.
