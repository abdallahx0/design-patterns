# Organizational Hierarchy Example

## Overview

In this example, we have a large organization where employees are grouped into various **departments**. Each department can contain individual employees as well as **sub-departments**. The organization needs a system to generate reports that provide hierarchical information, such as the total salary for a department, including all sub-departments and employees within it.

### Key Requirements

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Departments should be able to contain both individual employees and other sub-departments. This structure allows for a flexible representation of the organization’s hierarchy.
2. **Aggregated Reporting**: The organization needs to calculate and display the total salary for any department, including its employees and any nested sub-departments.

### Example Scenario

For example, let’s say there’s a **Sales** department. Within the Sales department, there are individual employees (e.g., sales managers, representatives) and a **Regional Sales** sub-department. The system should be able to calculate the total salary for the entire Sales department, taking into account all employees and nested sub-departments.

## Design Pattern Used: Composite Pattern

### Composite Pattern Overview

The **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to build a tree-like structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when:

- You need to represent a part-whole hierarchy of objects.
- You want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way.
- You need to perform operations recursively over a composite structure.

In our organizational hierarchy example:

- **Component**: Represents both employees and departments in the hierarchy.
- **Leaf**: Represents individual employees, as they are the lowest-level entities and cannot contain other objects.
- **Composite**: Represents departments, which can contain both employees and other sub-departments.

### Pattern Structure

1. **Component (OrganizationEntity)**: Defines an interface for all components in the hierarchy. This includes common operations such as calculating salaries.
2. **Leaf (Employee)**: Represents individual employees with specific salaries.
3. **Composite (Department)**: Represents departments, which can contain multiple components (employees or sub-departments). It also implements methods to add and manage these components.

### Benefits

- **Simplified Client Code**: Clients can work with complex tree structures using a single interface, reducing complexity.
- **Flexible Hierarchical Structures**: Makes it easy to add or remove components dynamically, as departments and employees can be managed uniformly.
- **Ease of Expansion**: New components (such as other types of employees or departments) can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

### Example Application

Using the Composite Pattern in this scenario allows the company to represent its hierarchical structure effectively. Each department can recursively calculate its total salary by summing up its own employees' salaries and those of its sub-departments. This makes it simple to generate reports for any part of the organization, no matter how deeply nested.

## Conclusion

The Composite Pattern is a suitable solution for building a flexible, hierarchical structure for organizations, especially when departments and employees need to be treated uniformly. This pattern makes it straightforward to generate reports that aggregate data across different levels of the hierarchy, providing valuable insights into the organizational structure.
