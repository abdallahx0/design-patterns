# Employee Schedule Management System

## Overview

This project is a **software system** for managing employee schedules across different departments and shifts. It supports various schedule types such as **Day Shift**, **Night Shift**, and **Remote Work**. In addition to handling basic operations like generating reports and calculating overtime, the system is now being extended to manage **leave requests** for each schedule type without altering the existing codebase significantly, as it is in **Production**.

To introduce this new functionality, we employ the **Visitor Design Pattern**, allowing us to extend the behavior of schedule types without modifying their original implementation.

## Visitor Design Pattern

The **Visitor Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you add further operations to objects without modifying their structure. In this system, it allows us to introduce the leave request feature for each schedule type without changing the existing code. 

### How it works:

- **Visitor**: This defines the operation (e.g., managing leave requests) to be performed on different schedule types.
- **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the specific operation for each schedule type (Day Shift, Night Shift, Remote Work).
- **Visitable (Element)**: Defines the interface for accepting visitors.
- **ConcreteVisitable (ConcreteElement)**: Represents each schedule type that accepts the visitor.

By using this pattern, we can handle different behaviors of leave requests across multiple schedules without modifying their core functionality.

## Conclusion
By applying the Visitor Pattern, we can extend the system's capabilities, like adding a new feature for managing leave requests, without modifying the existing schedule types or their internal logic. 
This approach ensures that the system remains robust and flexible in production.
