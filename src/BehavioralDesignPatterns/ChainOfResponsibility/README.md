# Web Application Request Processor

## Overview

This project is a **Web Application Request Processor** that handles incoming HTTP requests through multiple layers of middleware. Each request must pass through various checks, such as **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Security** checks, before reaching the core request handler. 

To handle this flow in a flexible and scalable manner, we implement the **Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern**.

## Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. In this system, each middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization, security checks) is treated as a handler in the chain.

### How it works:

1. **Handler (Middleware)**: Each middleware is responsible for processing a specific aspect of the request, such as **authentication**, **authorization**, or **security checks**. If the request passes the current handler's check, it is passed on to the next handler in the chain. If the request fails, the handler can block further processing or return an error.

2. **Concrete Handlers (Middleware Layers)**: 
   - **Authentication Handler**: Ensures that the incoming request has valid credentials.
   - **Authorization Handler**: Verifies that the authenticated user has permission to perform the requested operation.
   - **Security Handler**: Performs any additional security checks, such as IP filtering, CSRF token validation, etc.

3. **Client (Request Processor)**: The request processor initiates the handling of incoming HTTP requests by passing them through the chain of middleware handlers.

By using the Chain of Responsibility Pattern, the system becomes modular and extensible, allowing the addition or modification of middleware layers without affecting other parts of the application.

## Example Usage of Chain of Responsibility Pattern

### Key Components:
- **Middleware (Handler)**: Defines the base interface for all middleware handlers. Each handler processes a specific request and passes it to the next handler if the request is valid.
  
- **AuthenticationMiddleware (Concrete Handler)**: Verifies that the incoming request contains valid authentication credentials. If authentication fails, the request is rejected, and further processing stops.
  
- **AuthorizationMiddleware (Concrete Handler)**: Ensures that the authenticated user has the correct permissions to access the resource. If authorization fails, the request is rejected.

- **SecurityCheckMiddleware (Concrete Handler)**: Performs additional security checks such as verifying CSRF tokens, IP addresses, etc. If the security check fails, the request is blocked.

- **RequestProcessor (Client)**: Initiates the request processing by passing the incoming HTTP request through the chain of middleware.

### Core Operations:
1. **Process Request**: Each handler processes the request, and if the request passes the current handler's criteria, it is forwarded to the next handler in the chain.
   
2. **Stop Processing**: If any handler in the chain fails (e.g., invalid authentication or insufficient permissions), the chain stops, and an error is returned.

3. **Extensibility**: New middleware can be added to the chain (e.g., logging, caching, rate-limiting) without modifying the existing structure.

### Benefits:
- **Loose Coupling**: Each middleware is an independent handler, meaning changes to one handler don't affect others.
  
- **Modularity**: Each layer of middleware can focus on a single responsibility (e.g., authentication or authorization), leading to clear separation of concerns.

- **Extensibility**: New handlers can be added to the chain, such as additional security measures, logging, or performance monitoring, without disrupting existing logic.

## Conclusion

By implementing the **Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern**, this system effectively manages HTTP request processing through a chain of middleware for **authentication**, **authorization**, and **security** checks. This approach ensures the web application is flexible, scalable, and easy to extend with additional handlers. Each middleware is responsible for a specific aspect of the request, making the system modular and allowing for future enhancements with minimal code changes.
