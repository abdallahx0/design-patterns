# Newsletter System

## Overview

This project is a **Newsletter System** that allows clients to **subscribe** and **unsubscribe** to receive notifications. Whenever a new newsletter is published, the system sends a **notification** to all active subscribers. The system is built using the **Observer Design Pattern**, which ensures that all subscribers are automatically notified whenever the state of the newsletter system changes.

## Observer Design Pattern

The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing one object (the subject) to notify all its dependents (observers) automatically when its state changes. In our case, the newsletter system acts as the **subject**, and the clients (subscribers) are the **observers** who are notified whenever a new newsletter is published.

### How it works:

1. **Subject (Newsletter System)**: The newsletter system maintains a list of subscribers (observers) who are interested in receiving updates. It provides methods to **subscribe**, **unsubscribe**, and **notify** all observers when a new newsletter is published.

2. **Observer (Clients)**: Clients implement an interface that defines the update method. When they subscribe, they are added to the list of observers and receive notifications when the newsletter system triggers the event.

3. **Notification**: When the newsletter is updated or a new issue is published, the system notifies all subscribers by invoking their update method.

This pattern allows for loose coupling between the newsletter system and its clients, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## Example Usage of Observer Pattern

### Key Components:
- **Newsletter (Subject)**: The newsletter system where new issues are published. It keeps track of the list of subscribers and sends them notifications when a new update occurs.

- **Client (Observer)**: Each client represents a subscriber. They implement the `Notify()` method to receive notifications from the newsletter system whenever a new issue is published.

### Core Operations:
1. **Subscribe**: Clients can subscribe to the newsletter system by adding themselves to the list of observers.
   
2. **Unsubscribe**: Clients can remove themselves from the list if they no longer wish to receive updates.
   
3. **Notify Subscribers**: When a new newsletter issue is available, the system triggers the `Notify()` method to update all active subscribers.

### Benefits:
- **Loose Coupling**: The newsletter system and the clients are loosely coupled. The system doesnâ€™t need to know the details of the clients, only that they implement the observer interface.
  
- **Dynamic Updates**: New subscribers can be added, and current subscribers can be removed dynamically at runtime without affecting other parts of the system.

- **Scalability**: New clients can be easily integrated into the system, and the notification logic remains unchanged regardless of the number of subscribers.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the **Observer Design Pattern**, the newsletter system efficiently handles **subscriptions**, **unsubscriptions**, and the **notification** of subscribers whenever a new issue is published. The pattern ensures that the
